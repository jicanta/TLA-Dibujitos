# Flex-Bison-Compiler

A base compiler example, developed with Flex and Bison.

## Project Description

This project is a compiler implementation that uses Flex (for lexical analysis) and Bison (for syntax analysis) to process and compile source code. The compiler includes a tree visualization tool that helps in understanding the abstract syntax tree (AST) generated during the compilation process.

### Tree Visualizer

The tree visualizer is a key component of this project that provides a graphical representation of the abstract syntax tree. It helps developers and users to:

- Visualize the structure of parsed code
- Debug syntax analysis issues
- Understand the hierarchical relationships between different code elements
- Validate the correctness of the parser implementation

  * [Ubuntu](doc/readme/Ubuntu.md)

## Environment

Set the following environment variables to control and configure the behaviour of the application:

|Name|Default|Description|
|-|:-:|-|
|`LOG_IGNORED_LEXEMES`|`true`|When `true`, logs all of the ignored lexemes found with Flex at DEBUGGING level. To remove those logs from the console output set it to `false`.|
|`LOGGING_LEVEL`|`INFORMATION`|The minimum level to log in the console output. From lower to higher, the available levels are: `ALL`, `DEBUGGING`, `INFORMATION`, `WARNING`, `ERROR` and `CRITICAL`.|
|`SHOW_AST`|`false`|When `true`, enables the visualization of the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) in the web browser. Set to `false` to disable AST visualization.|

## CI/CD

To trigger an automatic integration on every push or PR (_Pull Request_), you must activate _GitHub Actions_ in the _Settings_ tab. Use the following configuration:

|Key|Value|
|-|-|
|Actions permissions|Allow all actions and reusable workflows|
|Artifact and log retention|`30 days`|
|Fork pull request workflows from outside collaborators|Require approval for all outside collaborators|
|Workflow permissions|Read repository contents and packages permissions|
|Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests|`false`|

After integration is done, change the badges of this `README.md` to point to the new repository.
